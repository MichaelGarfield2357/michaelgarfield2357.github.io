        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A 3D rendering pipeline built from scratch using Python, Pygame, and the standard Python Math library.
            I worked on this project in Grade 12 in high school. The rendering pipeline included in the GitHub repository
            represents the second version of the rendering pipeline I originally built in the summer of Grade 11. The second
            pipeline includes some basic shading and the standard transformation matrices; although the first pipeline includes
            occlusion algorithms such as the Painter's algorithm as well as a polygon clipping algorithm - which meant a lot 
            more computation and a lot slower. The second version takes advantage of the reduced computation in the transformation
            of the vertices encoded in the .obj file format which speeds up the pipeline - which meant that I could render a lot more
            triangles.
